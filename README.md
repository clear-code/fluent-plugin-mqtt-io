# Fluent::Plugin::Mqtt::IO

Fluent plugin for MQTT Input/Output
Mqtt::IO Plugin is deeply inspired by Fluent::Plugin::Mqtt.

https://github.com/yuuna/fluent-plugin-mqtt

Mqtt::IO plugin focus on federating components, e.g. sensors, messaging platform and databases.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fluent-plugin-mqtt-io'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fluent-plugin-mqtt-io


## Usage

fluent-plugin-mqtt provides Input and Output Plugins for MQTT.

Input Plugin can be used via source directive in the configuration.

```

<source>
  type mqtt
  bind 127.0.0.1
  port 1883
</source>

```

The default MQTT topic is "#". Configurable options are the following:

- bind: IP address of MQTT broker
- port: Port number of MQTT broker
- topic: Topic name to be subscribed
- username: User name for authentication
- password: Password for authentication
- ssl: set true if you want to use SSL/TLS. If set to true, the following parameter must be provided
  - ca_file: CA certificate file path
  - key_file: private key file path
  - cert_file: certificate file path
- format: Input parser can be chosen, e.g. json, xml
  - in order to use xml format, you need to install [fluent-plugin-xml-parser](https://github.com/toyokazu/fluent-plugin-xml-parser).

Input Plugin supports @label directive.

Output Plugin can be used via match directive.

```

<match topic.**>
  type mqtt
  bind 127.0.0.1
  port 1883
</match>

```

The options are basically the same as Input Plugin. The difference is the following.

- time_key: An attribute name used for timestamp field genarated from fluentd time field. Default is nil (omitted).
  If this option is omitted, timestamp field is not appended to the output record.
- time_format: Output format of timestamp field. Default is ISO8601. You can specify your own format by using TimeParser.
- topic_rewrite_pattern: Regexp pattern to extract replacement words from received topic or tag name
- topic_rewrite_replacement: Topic name used for the publish using extracted pattern

If you use different source, e.g. the other MQTT broker, log file and so on, there is no need to specifie topic rewriting. Skip the following descriptions.

The topic name or tag name, e.g. "topic", received from an event can not be published without modification because if MQTT input plugin connecting to the identical MQTT broker is used as a source, the same message will become an input repeatedly. In order to support data conversion in single MQTT domain, simple topic rewriting should be supported. Since topic is rewritten using #gsub method, 'pattern' and 'replacement' are the same as #gsub arguments.


```

<match topic.**>
  type mqtt
  bind 127.0.0.1
  port 1883
  topic_rewrite_pattern '^([\w\/]+)$'
  topic_rewrite_replacement '\1/rewritten'
</match>

```

You can also use mqtt_buf type which is implemented as BufferedOutput.

```

<match topic.**>
  type mqtt_buf
  bind 127.0.0.1
  port 1883
  topic_rewrite_pattern '^([\w\/]+)$'
  topic_rewrite_replacement '\1/rewritten'
  # You can specify Buffer Plugin options
  buffer_type memory
  flush_interval 1s
</match>

```
